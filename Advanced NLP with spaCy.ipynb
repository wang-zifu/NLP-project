    "\n",
    "spaCy can compare two objects and predict how similar they are â€“ for example, documents, spans or single tokens.  \n",
    "The Doc, Token and Span objects have a .similarity method that takes another object and returns a floating point number between 0 and 1, indicating how similar they are.  \n",
    "One thing that's very important: In order to use similarity, you need a larger spaCy model that has word vectors included. For example, the medium or large English model â€“ but not the small one. So if you want to use vectors, always go with a model that ends in \"md\" or \"lg\".  \n",
    "You can also use the similarity methods to compare different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word vectors:**  \n",
    "Similarity is determined using word vectors, multi-dimensional representations of meanings of words.  \n",
    "You might have heard of Word2Vec, which is an algorithm that's often used to train word vectors from raw text.  \n",
    "Vectors can be added to spaCy's statistical models.  \n",
    "By default, the similarity returned by spaCy is the cosine similarity between two vectors â€“ but this can be adjusted if necessary.  \n",
    "Vectors for objects consisting of several tokens, like the Doc and Span, default to the average of their token vectors.  \n",
    "That's also why you usually get more value out of shorter phrases with fewer irrelevant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarity depends on the application context:**  \n",
    "Predicting similarity can be useful for many types of applications. For example, to recommend a user similar texts based on the ones they have read. It can also be helpful to flag duplicate content, like posts on an online platform.  \n",
    "However, it's important to keep in mind that there's no objective definition of what's similar and what isn't. It always depends on the context and what your application needs to do.  \n",
    "Here's an example: spaCy's default word vectors assign a very high similarity score to \"I like cats\" and \"I hate cats\". This makes sense, because both texts express sentiment about cats. But in a different application context, you might want to consider the phrases as very dissimilar, because they talk about opposite sentiments."

Instead of providing a list of all person names ever, your application will be able to predict whether a span of tokens is a person name. Similarly, you can predict dependency labels to find subject/object relationships.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Atribute extensions:** \n",
    "Attribute extensions set a default value that can be overwritten.  \n",
    "For example, a custom is_color attribute on the token that defaults to False.  \n",
    "On individual tokens, its value can be changed by overwriting it â€“ in this case, True for the token \"blue\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Property extensions:**  \n",
    "Property extensions work like properties in Python: they can define a getter function and an optional setter.  \n",
    "The getter function is only called when you retrieve the attribute. This lets you compute the value dynamically, and even take other custom attributes into account.  \n",
    "Getter functions take one argument: the object, in this case, the token. In this example, the function returns whether the token text is in our list of colors.  \n",
    "We can then provide the function via the getter keyword argument when we register the extension.  \n",
    "The token \"blue\" now returns True for `._.is_color.`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to set extension attributes on a span, you almost always want to use a property extension with a getter. Otherwise, you'd have to update every possible span ever by hand to set all the values.  \n",
    "In this example, the get_has_color function takes the span and returns whether the text of any of the tokens is in the list of colors.  \n",
    "After we've processed the doc, we can check different slices of the doc and the custom `._.has_color` property returns whether the span contains a color token or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method extensions:**  \n",
    "Method extensions make the extension attribute a callable method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then pass one or more arguments to it, and compute attribute values dynamically â€“ for example, based on a certain argument or setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the method function checks whether the doc contains a token with a given text. The first argument of the method is always the object itself â€“ in this case, the doc. It's passed in automatically when the method is called. All other function arguments will be arguments on the method extension. In this case, token_text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the custom `._.has_token` method returns True for the word \"blue\" and False for the word \"cloud\"."

    "If you need to process a lot of texts and create a lot of Doc objects in a row, the `nlp.pipe` method can speed this up significantly.  \n",

    "It is much faster than just calling nlp on each text, because it batches up the texts.  \n",
    "`nlp.pipe` is a generator that yields Doc objects, so in order to get a list of docs, remember to call the list method around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nlp.pipe` also supports passing in tuples of text / context if you set as_tuples to True.  \n",
    "The method will then yield doc / context tuples.  \n",
    "This is useful for passing in additional metadata, like an ID associated with the text, or a page number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even add the context metadata to custom attributes.  \n",
    "In this example, we're registering two extensions, id and page_number, which default to None.  \n",
    "After processing the text and passing through the context, we can overwrite the doc extensions with our context metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common scenario: Sometimes you already have a model loaded to do other processing, but you only need the tokenizer for one particular text.  \n",
    "Running the whole pipeline is unnecessarily slow, because you'll be getting a bunch of predictions from the model that you don't need.  \n",
    "If you only need a tokenized Doc object, you can use the nlp.make_doc method instead, which takes a text and returns a doc.\n",
    "This is also how spaCy does it behind the scenes: `nlp.make_doc` turns the text into a doc before the pipeline components are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy also allows you to temporarily disable pipeline components using the nlp.disable_pipes context manager.  \n",
    "It takes a variable number of arguments, the string names of the pipeline components to disable. For example, if you only want to use the entity recognizer to process a document, you can temporarily disable the tagger and parser.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Why would we want to update the model with our own examples? Why can't we just rely on pre-trained models?  \n",
    "Statistical models make predictions based on the examples they were trained on.  \n",
    "You can usually make the model more accurate by showing it examples from your domain.  \n",
    "You often also want to predict categories specific to your problem, so the model needs to learn about them.  \n",
    "This is essential for text classification, very useful for entity recognition and a little less critical for tagging and parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy supports updating existing models with more examples, and training new models.  \n",
    "If we're not starting with a pre-trained model, we first initialize the weights randomly.  \n",
    "Next, we call nlp.update, which predicts a batch of examples with the current weights.  \n",
    "The model then checks the predictions against the correct answers, and decides how to change the weights to achieve better predictions next time.  \n",
    "Finally, we make a small correction to the current weights and move on to the next batch of examples.  \n",
    "We continue calling nlp.update for each batch of examples in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data are the examples we want to update the model with.  \n",
    "The text should be a sentence, paragraph or longer document. For the best results, it should be similar to what the model will see at runtime.  \n",
    "The label is what we want the model to predict. This can be a text category, or an entity span and its type.  \n",
    "The gradient is how we should change the model to reduce the current error. It's computed when we compare the predicted label to the true label.  \n",
    "After training, we can then save out an updated model and use it in our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example for a specific component: the entity recognizer.  \n",
    "The entity recognizer takes a document and predicts phrases and their labels. This means that the training data needs to include texts, the entities they contain, and the entity labels.  \n",
    "Entities can't overlap, so each token can only be part of one entity.  \n",
    "Because the entity recognizer predicts entities in context, it also needs to be trained on entities and their surrounding context.  \n",
    "The easiest way to do this is to show the model a text and a list of character offsets. For example, \"iPhone X\" is a gadget, starts at character 0 and ends at character 8.  \n",
    "e.g. `(\"iPhone X is coming\", {\"entities\": [(0, 8, \"GADGET\")]})`  \n",
    "It's also very important for the model to learn words that aren't entities.  \n",
    "In this case, the list of span annotations will be empty.  \n",
    "e.g. `(\"I need a new phone! Any tips?\", {\"entities\": []})`\n",
    "Our goal is to teach the model to recognize new entities in similar contexts, even if they weren't in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data tells the model what we want it to predict. This could be texts and named entities we want to recognize, or tokens and their correct part-of-speech tags.  \n",
    "To update an existing model, we can start with a few hundred to a few thousand examples.  \n",
    "To train a new category we may need up to a million.  \n",
    "spaCy's pre-trained English models for instance were trained on 2 million words labelled with part-of-speech tags, dependencies and named entities.  \n",

    "### The training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The training loop is a series of steps that's performed to train or update a model.  \n",
    "We usually need to perform it several times, for multiple iterations, so that the model can learn from it effectively. If we want to train for 10 iterations, we need to loop 10 times.  \n",
    "To prevent the model from getting stuck in a suboptimal solution, we randomly shuffle the data for each iteration. This is a very common strategy when doing stochastic gradient descent.  \n",
    "Next, we divide the training data into batches of several examples, also known as minibatching. This increases the reliability of the gradient estimates.  \n",
    "Finally, we update the model for each batch, and start the loop again until we've reached the last iteration.  \n",
    "We can then save the model to a directory and use it in spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy lets you update an existing pre-trained model with more data â€“ for example, to improve its predictions on different texts.  \n",
    "This is especially useful if you want to improve categories the model already knows, like \"person\" or \"organization\".  \n",
    "You can also update a model to add new categories.  \n",
    "Just make sure to always update it with examples of the new category and examples of the other categories it previously predicted correctly. Otherwise improving the new category might hurt the other categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we start off with a blank English model using the spacy.blank method. The blank model doesn't have any pipeline components, only the language data and tokenization rules.  \n",
    "We then create a blank entity recognizer and add it to the pipeline.  \n",
    "Using the add_label method, we can add new string labels to the model.  \n",
    "We can now call nlp.begin_training to initialize the model with random weights.  \n",
    "To get better accuracy, we want to loop over the examples more than once and randomly shuffle the data on each iteration.  \n",
    "On each iteration, we divide the examples into batches using spaCy's minibatch utility function. Each example consists of a text and its annotations.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Statistical models can learn lots of things â€“ but it doesn't mean that they won't unlearn them.  \n",
    "If you're updating an existing model with new data, especially new labels, it can overfit and adjust too much to the new examples.  \n",
    "For instance, if you're only updating it with examples of \"website\", it may \"forget\" other labels it previously predicted correctly â€“ like \"person\".  \n",

    "You can then mix those examples in with your existing data and update the model with annotations of all labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem is that your model just won't learn what you want it to.  \n",
    "spaCy's models make predictions based on the local context â€“ for example, for named entities, the surrounding words are most important.  \n",
    "If the decision is difficult to make based on the context, the model can struggle to learn it.  \n",
    "The label scheme also needs to be consistent and not too specific.  \n",
    "For example, it may be very difficult to teach a model to predict whether something is adult clothing or children's clothing based on the context. However, just predicting the label \"clothing\" may work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start training and updating models, it's worth taking a step back and planning your label scheme.  \n",
