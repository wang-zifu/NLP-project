    "### Word vectors and semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy can compare two objects and predict how similar they are â€“ for example, documents, spans or single tokens.  \n",
    "The Doc, Token and Span objects have a .similarity method that takes another object and returns a floating point number between 0 and 1, indicating how similar they are.  \n",
    "One thing that's very important: In order to use similarity, you need a larger spaCy model that has word vectors included. For example, the medium or large English model â€“ but not the small one. So if you want to use vectors, always go with a model that ends in \"md\" or \"lg\".  \n",
    "You can also use the similarity methods to compare different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word vectors:**  \n",
    "Similarity is determined using word vectors, multi-dimensional representations of meanings of words.  \n",
    "You might have heard of Word2Vec, which is an algorithm that's often used to train word vectors from raw text.  \n",
    "Vectors can be added to spaCy's statistical models.  \n",
    "By default, the similarity returned by spaCy is the cosine similarity between two vectors â€“ but this can be adjusted if necessary.  \n",
    "Vectors for objects consisting of several tokens, like the Doc and Span, default to the average of their token vectors.  \n",
    "That's also why you usually get more value out of shorter phrases with fewer irrelevant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarity depends on the application context:**  \n",
    "Predicting similarity can be useful for many types of applications. For example, to recommend a user similar texts based on the ones they have read. It can also be helpful to flag duplicate content, like posts on an online platform.  \n",
    "However, it's important to keep in mind that there's no objective definition of what's similar and what isn't. It always depends on the context and what your application needs to do.  \n",
    "Here's an example: spaCy's default word vectors assign a very high similarity score to \"I like cats\" and \"I hate cats\". This makes sense, because both texts express sentiment about cats. But in a different application context, you might want to consider the phrases as very dissimilar, because they talk about opposite sentiments."

Instead of providing a list of all person names ever, your application will be able to predict whether a span of tokens is a person name. Similarly, you can predict dependency labels to find subject/object relationships.  \n",
